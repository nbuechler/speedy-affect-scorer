A lot of improvements to the User Interface when it comes to changing color for
differing between nouns/verbs/adjectives as general categories. So, I'm making
the POS tagging apparent to the user so that the user can see the relationship
between POS and affect via color.

I also improve the User Experience by allowing the User to turn off parts of the
processing, which can improve the amount of time it takes to understand the affect.

Additionally, I included a 'Ranking Summary' and 'Lagger Summary' to show the way
in which a set of emotions produces different '[blends]' of affect.

    Affect is the measurable observation of an emotion.

        e.g. A particularly relevant affect is natural language

    Affects are defined by the observed reality (via some kind of sign) of a person.

    Examples of affect include a facial expression, natural language sentence (Syntagam), tone, body temperature and/or another aspect of their person.
‘Representational’ Emotions (R-EMOTION)

    Linguistic labels (signifier/signified pairs) used to define an emotion.

        Affects can be recorded and observed in sets of multiple R-EMOTION s.

        e.g. A particularly popular set: Paul Ekman’s Big 6

‘Inferential’ Emotions (I-EMOTION)

    I-EMOTION s are an interpretation of how culture (as an emergent quality of human systems) constructs signifier/signified pairs of emotion where I-EMOTION s represent these as a vector of multiple R-EMOTION s.

        Important: R-EMOTION s are symbolic and are not the same as ‘Inferential’ Emotions (I-EMOTION).

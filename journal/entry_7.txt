I added stemming and lemmatizizing today. This improves the main Business Logic
part of the affect scorer for NLP.

if word in order_3:
        is_in_order_3+=1
        list_of_order_3.append(word)
    elif stemmer.stem(word) in order_3:
        is_in_order_3+=1
        list_of_order_3.append(stemmer.stem(word))
    elif lemma.lemmatize(word) in order_3:
        is_in_order_3+=1
        list_of_order_3.append(lemma.lemmatize(word))

Previously, over the past view days I improved the User Interface

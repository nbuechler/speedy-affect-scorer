Affect : R-emotion : I-emotion

Affect is the measurable symptom of an emotion that we observe. Affect allows us to use our linguistics to define an emotion, hence those language based emotions are called a 'Representational' Emotions (R-EMOTION). Affects usually are defined by the observed reality of a person, such as a facial expression, sentence, tone, body temperature and/or another aspect of their person. Affects can be recorded as a set of multiple R-EMOTION s. R-EMOTION s are symbolic and are not the same as 'Inferential' Emotions (I-EMOTION). I-EMOTION s are an inference to a the emotional qualia in humans which can be represented as a vector of multiple R-EMOTION s.
